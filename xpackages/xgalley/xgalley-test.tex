\newcommand*\fillertext{%
This is some filler text for testing out \textsf{xgalley}. It is a few
lines long so that things like indents, cutouts and so forth will 
actually show up. Of course, this text is rather boring as it has been
written purely to take up some lines in this document. It might have
been better to copy something from an interesting book, but then the
text would be more important than the appearance, which would not be
very helpful.
