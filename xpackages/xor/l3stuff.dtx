% this needs a bit of further thought and the names may have to change. the
% basic idea that if you want to base the default value of some tl kind of
% key on some other key value then right now this can't be directly specified in
% the template (perhaps it should). so what this below does is the following:
% we set the key to a value which one can't specify with  |\tl_set:Nn| (i.e.,
% basically invalid) and later test if this value is still the case.

\cs_new_nopar:Npn \TP_unset_key:N #1 {
    \cs_set_eq:NN #1 \scan_stop:
}

\cs_new_eq:NN \if_TP_key_unset:NT \cs_if_free:NT
\cs_new_eq:NN \if_TP_key_unset:NF \cs_if_free:NF
