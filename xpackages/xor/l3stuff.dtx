%%% template support (maybe ...)

% this needs a bit of further thought and the names may have to change. the
% basic idea that if you want to base the default value of some tlp kind of
% key on some other key value then right now this can't be directly specified in
% the template (perhaps it should). so what this below does is the following:
% we set the key to a value which one can't specify with  |\tlp_set:Nn| (i.e.,
% basically invalid) and later test if this value is still the case.

\def_new:Npn \TP_unset_key:N #1 {
    \let:NN #1 \scan_stop:
}

\let_new:NN \if_TP_key_unset:NT \cs_if_free:NT
