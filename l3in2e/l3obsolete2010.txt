Removed				Replacement
-------				----------

All \intexpr_ functions have been replaced by equivalent \int_ functions.
Using a separate "intexpr" module prefix was only necessary when we were
distinguishing between integers in l3int and l3num, the latter of which is
now deprecated.

In addition, the following two primitives have been removed, as they already
had other names.

\if_intexpr_case:w        \if_case:w
\int_to_number:w          \int_value:w
